Although I thought I had only created a plain old 2D ragdoll at that point, (planning to animate/bring it to life later), I was surprised to find that it already had a life of it's own. This is due to something in [Godot's (currently experimental) implementation of PhysicalBone2D,](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/78367#issuecomment-2920189426) but I'm not knowledgable enough to do more than guess the deeper cause.
